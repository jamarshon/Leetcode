/*
926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing
A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some number
of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a
'1' to a '0'.

Return the minimum number of flips to make SÂ monotone increasing.

Example 1:

Input: "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.

Example 2:

Input: "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.

Example 3:

Input: "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.

Note:

  1 <= S.length <= 20000
  S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.
