682. Baseball Game
You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

Example 1:
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.
Example 2:
Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
Note:
The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

692. Top K Frequent Words
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word 
with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Input words contain only lowercase letters.
Follow up:
Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.

696. Count Binary Substrings
Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, 
and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
Note:

Example 1:

771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" 
is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

804. Unique Morse Code Words
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as 
follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. 
For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-.-....-", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call 
such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
 

Note:

The length of words will be at most 100.
Each words[i] will have length in range [1, 12].
words[i] will only consist of lowercase letters.

806. Number of Lines To Write String
We are to write the letters of a given string S, from left to right into lines. Each line has maximum width 100 units, 
and if writing a letter would cause the width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are given 
an array widths, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', ..., and widths[25] is the width of 'z'.

Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from S, and what is the width used by the last such line? 
Return your answer as an integer list of length 2.

Example :
Input: 
widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: [3, 60]
Explanation: 
All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
we need two full lines and one line with 60 units.
Example :
Input: 
widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "bbbcccdddaaa"
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 
All letters except 'a' have the same length of 10, and 
"bbbcccdddaa" will cover 9 * 10 + 2 * 4 = 98 units.
For the last 'a', it is written on the second line because
there is only 2 units left in the first line.
So the answer is 2 lines, plus 4 units in the second line.
 
Note:

The length of S will be in the range [1, 1000].
S will only contain lowercase letters.
widths is an array of length 26.
widths[i] will be in the range of [2, 10].

811. Subdomain Visit Count
A website domain like "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", 
at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like 
"discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.

Now, call a "count-paired domain" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, 
followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be "9001 discuss.leetcode.com".

We are given a list cpdomains of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the 
input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.

Example 1:
Input: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output: 
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
Explanation: 
We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com". As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. 
So they will all be visited 9001 times.

Example 2:
Input: 
["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output: 
["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation: 
We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times. For the subdomains, 
we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.

Notes:

The length of cpdomains will not exceed 100. 
The length of each domain name will not exceed 100.
Each address will have either 1 or 2 "." characters.
The input count in any count-paired domain will not exceed 10000.
The answer output can be returned in any order.
