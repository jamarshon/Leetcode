662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the 
given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. 
The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some 
nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes 
(the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null 
nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

Example 1:
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the 
length 4 (5,3,null,9).
Example 2:
Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the 
length 2 (5,3).
Example 3:
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the 
length 2 (3,2).
Example 4:
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       /     \  
      5       9 
     /         \
    6           7
Output: 8
Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the 
length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).

676. Implement Magic Dictionary

Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.

For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify exactly one character into another 
character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

Example 1:
Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
Input: search("hello"), Output: False
Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
Input: search("hell"), Output: False
Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
Note:
You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are persisted 
across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.

682. Baseball Game
You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

Example 1:
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.
Example 2:
Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
Note:
The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

692. Top K Frequent Words
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word 
with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

696. Count Binary Substrings
Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, 
and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
Note:

s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

697. Degree of an Array
Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Note:

nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.

720. Longest Word in Dictionary
Given a list of strings words representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in words that can be 
built one character at a time by other words in words. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with 
the smallest lexicographical order.

If there is no answer, return the empty string.
Example 1:
Input: 
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: 
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
Example 2:
Input: 
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: 
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
Note:

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of words will be in the range [1, 1000].
The length of words[i] will be in the range [1, 30].

728. Self Dividing Numbers
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

Example 1:
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22

762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in 
their binary representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 
10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

Example 1:

Input: L = 6, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
Example 2:

Input: L = 10, R = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
Note:

L, R will be integers L <= R in the range [1, 10^6].
R - L will be at most 10000.
