771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S
representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you
have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
