696. Count Binary Substrings
Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, 
and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
Note:

s.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
s will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

        suppose there is prev_cnt which is the number of repeated characters before index i that is
        different than s[i].
        Find how many s[i] repeats e.g. if it repeats from [i,j)
        The number of times s[i] repeats (j-i) and the number of times previous character repeated (prev_cnt)
        and the minimum between these two is the number of times that the substrings can have the same
        number of characters from both characters.

        3 4
        000 1111

        000 111, 00 11, 0 1
