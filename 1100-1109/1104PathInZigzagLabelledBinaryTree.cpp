/*
1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are
labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is
left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the
labelling is right to left.

Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the
root of the tree to theÂ node with that label.

Example 1:

Input: label = 14
Output: [1,3,4,14]

Example 2:

Input: label = 26
Output: [1,2,6,10,26]

Constraints:

  1 <= label <= 10^6
