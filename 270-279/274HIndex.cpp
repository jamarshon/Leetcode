274. H-Index
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) 
of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has 
index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and 
the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the 
researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 
3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 
3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two 
with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one 
is taken as the h-index.

    h index is choose index from [0,n] such that

    Bucket sort
    bucket[i] for i = [0,n) indicates frequency of value i
    in citations. bucket[n] indications frequency of value >= n
    in citations.

    sum[i] shows how many element are greater than or equal to
    i so if sum[i] >= i then h = i as there are sum[i] elements
    greater than or equal to i and N - i elements smaller than
    i.
