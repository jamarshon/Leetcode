521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I
Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. 
The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence 
should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the 
order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest 
uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: "aba", "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"), 
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", 
but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings. 
Note:

Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.
Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.

      question is asking if for all subsequences of A (ss_A) and all subsequences of B (ss_B)
      what is the longest ss_A that is not ss_B and vice versa

      if A == B, then no matter what subsequence of A is made, it can be made in B so return -1
      if len(A) > len(B) then removing letters from B will always be smaller than A so return A
      if len(A) < len(B) then removing letters from A will always be smaller than B  so return B
      if len(A) == len(B), since they are not the same if we arbitrarily choose A and start removing letters from B
      it will always be smaller than A, so return A. the samething can occur if choose B arbitrarily.
