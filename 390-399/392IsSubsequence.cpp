/*
392. Is Subsequence
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in 
both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, 
and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the 
original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters 
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, 
and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. 
In this scenario, how would you change your code?
